            <h2>We Are The Problem</h2>
            <p>It goes without saying that littering the world has negative effects. The results of inappropriate waste management and trash disposal can lead to detrimental results of soil, ocean, air and groundwater pollution. It directly affects ecosystems and species health; including our own. It is only expected to get worse. Waste production is predicted to increase by 70% in the next 30 years unless major and rapid changes were to be made.</p>

        <h2>Making A Change</h2>
        <p>On average, a typical American consumer produces about 1,642 pounds of trash each year. Though it might seem hopeless reducing such a high number as it can add up pretty quickly, if broken down- itâ€™s about 4 pounds of trash per day- a significantly less intimidating number. Being aware of the situation is only the first step. As individuals, there are plenty of ways we can change the amount of trash being produced locally. Methods of composting, recycling, and utilizing reusable products impacts the community and as more people join the effort, the effects will be felt nationally and soon after, globally.</p>
